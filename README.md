This was a chunk of code written in an afternoon to facilitate creating, voting on, and finally sorting a slew of AI generated Magic: The Gathering cards using the now defunct Urza.ai. Rest in peace. 
What followed generating thousands of cards over the course of a few months was voting on whether cards would make it into a final, playable set. Votes continued
until exactly 360 cards remained, at which point we sent them to the printer. Some weeks later our cards were delivered. We sleeved them up and spent the day
playing with cards generated with AI, voted on by our Discord server. The future is pretty rad.
